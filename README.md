# Marketing-Attribution

CoolTShirts, an innovative apparel shop, is running a bunch of marketing campaigns. In this project, I was be helping them answer these questions about their campaigns:

1. Getting familiar with the company.

How many campaigns and sources does CoolTShirts use and how are they related? 
What pages are on their website and how many visitors make a purchase?

2. What is the user journey?

How many first touches is each campaign responsible for?
How many last touches is each campaign responsible for?
How many last touches on the purchase page is each campaign responsible for?

3. CoolTShirts can re-invest in 5 campaigns. Which should they pick and why?
