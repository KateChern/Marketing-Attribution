# Marketing-Attribution

CoolTShirts, an innovative apparel shop, is running a bunch of marketing campaigns. In this project, I was helping them answer these questions about their campaigns:

Getting familiar with the company:
- How many campaigns and sources does CoolTShirts use and how are they related? 
- What pages are on their website and how many visitors make a purchase?

The user journey:
- How many first touches is each campaign responsible for?
- How many last touches is each campaign responsible for?
- How many last touches on the purchase page is each campaign responsible for?

Reinvesting:
- CoolTShirts can re-invest in 5 campaigns. Which should they pick and why?
